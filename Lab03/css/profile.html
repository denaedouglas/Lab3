		<p class="bio" style="text-align:right;">This is D'Angelo (Michael Eugene Archer), my favorite <br>musician/artist. He began his mainstream
		music career <br>in 1995 with the critically acclaimed album, Brown Sugar.<br> As a master musician and distinguished
		songwriter, he made <br>his mark on the music scene, and paved the way for many artists<br> in the genres like R&B/Soul
		as well as neo-soul. Five years later<br>he released the platinum selling album Voodoo (2000). He shaped<br> his own
		style and carved out a real place for himself with the<br>album's deep lyrics, raw beats, and beautiful melodies.
		After a 14<br>year hiatus, D'Angelo made his return to the music scene when he<br> released Black Messiah (2014),
		a politically charged album with a<br> message for the times regarding the senseless killings of young black<br> men by
		police officers. In addition to the thought provoking lyrics of<br>songs like The Charade, and Prayer, D'Angelo
		doesn't fall short in<br> the groove department. After 20+ years on the music scene, D'Angelo<br> is as fresh and relevant
		as ever.</p>
